# Testing Initial Review

## Overview

The azl_bot project has 127 collected tests across 12 test files, covering core components like coordinate transforms, LLM client, state machine, dataset capture, and UI enhancements. Overall test quality is mixed: approximately 40% are high-quality unit tests (A/B grades) that deeply test core logic with proper mocking, 40% are adequate but superficial (C grade), and 20% are marginal or broken (D/F grades). Key strengths include comprehensive coordinate system testing and LLM client mocking. Weaknesses include insufficient error case coverage, some broken tests, and lack of integration tests for full workflows. Recommendations: Fix broken tests, add more error scenarios, implement integration tests, and remove or improve low-value tests.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix broken tests**: Address test_config_validation.py::test_invalid_resolution which expects validation that doesn't exist.
2. **Add error case coverage**: Many tests lack comprehensive error scenario testing (e.g., network failures, invalid inputs).
3. **Implement integration tests**: Add end-to-end tests for complete task execution workflows.
4. **Remove low-value tests**: Consider removing trivial tests like existence checks or basic imports.
5. **Improve mocking**: Some tests could benefit from better isolation of external dependencies.
6. **Add performance benchmarks**: For critical paths like coordinate transforms and vision processing.
7. **Test configuration validation**: Implement and test config schema validation comprehensively.
8. **Add property-based testing**: For mathematical functions like coordinate transforms.
